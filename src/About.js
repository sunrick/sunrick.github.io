              <h3> a little about me </h3>
              <p>
                I'm half Swedish half American and I've been really fortunate to grow up all over the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                On any given day, you can catch me walking my dog Bj√∂rn, saying something really stupid to my friends, kicking a soccer ball or playing video games.
              </p>
              <h3> why I get up in the morning </h3>
              <p>
                I want to build software that helps people.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like to learn something new everyday. It doesn't really matter about what it is. It could be about programming and technology, languages, or about how a toilet works.
              </p>
              <h3> my programming history </h3>
              <p>
                I've been a professional software developer since 2015.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before that I programmed Excel VBA scripts and web scrapers for fun and work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I develop React JS and Native apps. I build backend APIs with Express.js, Elixir (Phoenix) and Rails.
              </p>
            </Column>
          </Columns>

      </Wrapper>
